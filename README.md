# REST-API-Java

# **Description:**
After fiddling around a lot, the basics of the API are working. I have created some Backend API's lately using Node.JS (MEAN Stack Web-App), so I know what to do. However, it is my first time working with Maven and first time in months writing in Java, so the setup and getting back into Java took some time. Still need to implement the proper JSON formatted response. After that dividing up the classes and methods into more files so the code is cleaner and adding comments where necessary. I haven't (ever) implemented testing yet, so that will take longer. 


# Usage Guide 
- Just run the main function, this will start a jetty server on PORT: 8000
- Use postman to create a POST request, containing a JSON
- Response will contain proper HTTP Response Code and the "result" message


# Assignment: create a REST api in Java

- 1: All transaction references need to be unique
- 2: End balance needs to be validated
- 3: Assignment should be submitted as a maven project
- 4: Junit should be well written
- 5: (medior) Integration test should be implemented

# DONE:
- Servlet using Jetty
- Basic REST Api to receive POST requests
- JSON parser
- Validation of references
- Validation of endbalance
- HTTP Status Code + Response message
- Tested using Postman
- Proper formatting of response (JSON with result message and errorrecords)

# TODO:
- Clean up formatting and code
- Write unit tests in Junit
- Write integration tests
