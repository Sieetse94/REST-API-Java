# REST-API-Java

# **Description:**
After fiddling around a lot, the basics of the API are working. First time working with Maven, first time in months writing in Java. Still need to implement the proper JSON formatted response.


# Usage Guide 
- Just run the main function, this will start a jetty server on PORT: 8000
- Use postman to create a POST request, containing a JSON
- Response will contain proper HTTP Response Code and the "result" message


# Assignment: create a REST api in Java

- 1: All transaction references need to be unique
- 2: End balance needs to be validated
- 3: Assignment should be submitted as a maven project
- 4: Junit should be well written
- 5: (medior) Integration test should be implemented

# DONE:
- Servlet using Jetty
- Basic REST Api to receive POST requests
- JSON parser
- Validation of references
- Validation of endbalance
- HTTP Status Code + Response message
- Tested using Postman

# TODO:
- Proper formatting of response (JSON with result message and errorrecords)
- Clean up formatting and code
- Write unit tests in Junit
- Write integration tests
